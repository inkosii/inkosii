## 😊 About Me

I’m a passionate **Java developer** with a solid academic foundation through a  
**BSc in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science**.

My degree shaped the way I think — logically, analytically, and creatively — allowing me to approach software development with mathematical precision.  

Java is more than just a programming language to me;  
**it’s the craft I use to build scalable systems, backend logic, and real-world solutions.**  
I also use Python for data analysis, forecasting, visualization, and rapid app building.

# 📊 Featured Project (Primary):  
# **Eskom Load Shedding Impact Analysis**

A deep, data-driven exploration of how **load shedding affects South Africa’s economy**, municipal energy usage, and household activity patterns.

This is one of my most meaningful projects because it blends:
✔ Applied Mathematics  
✔ Data analysis  
✔ Real-world South African challenges  
✔ Visual, interactive apps  

---

## 🔍 Data Collection — From StatsSA

All datasets were sourced directly from **StatsSA**, including:

- Electricity generation & distribution  
- Municipal energy usage  
- Sectoral GDP contributions  
- Household activity datasets  
- Time-series datasets aligned with load-shedding events  

This ensures the analysis is **accurate, high-quality, and nationally representative**.

---

## 🚧 Project Highlights

### 📈 **1. Statistical & Time-Series Modeling**
I implemented:

- Load-shedding intensity vs economic output correlations  
- Time-series decomposition  
- Rolling window forecasts  
- Regression-based impact estimation  
- Seasonality + crisis pattern detection  

### 🧮 **2. Mathematical Rigor**
Leveraging my Applied Math background, I used:

- Multivariate regression  
- Error propagation models  
- Signal smoothing  
- Normalization + detrending  
- Confidence interval forecasting  

### 🏗️ **3. Application Development**
To make the research accessible:

- **Streamlit dashboards** (interactive charts, sliders, filters)  
- **Gradio demos** (lightweight previews)  
- **Docker containerization** (portable and deployable)  

This turned complex research into a **user-friendly analytics tool**.
